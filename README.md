# Day-Planner

This project was to create a Day Planner meeting the following criteria.  

- When the page is opened, the current date is displayed at the top.
- There's a list of timeblocks for standard business hours.
- The timeblocks are color coded depending on time of day to past, present or current.
- When a timeblock is clicked, an event can be entered into that timeblock.
- When the save button is clicked, the event is saved to local storage and persists upon reload.
